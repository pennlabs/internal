Labs Code Review
=====

At Labs, all submitted code must be reviewed and approved by one other
full-time developer. Reviews are done through GitHub.

Requester's responsibilities
-----

- Make sure the code actually works through testing.
- Make sure the commit history is clean (i.e., commits are logical and
discrete pieces; in practice this usually means one commit per pull request,
though this is by no means a rule).
- Make sure a reviewer is assigned and aware of the pull request.
- Keep a code review on track (e.g., pinging the reviewer if you've changed
something and need further approval, or politely following up if they haven't
responded).
- Merge the pull request once it has been approved and delete the remote
branch.

Reviewer's responsibilities
-----

- Respond to code reviews promptly. This means the same day if during a normal
meeting, or within a day if outside a normal meeting.
- Review all the code and make sure it's in line with our
[Style Guide](style-guide.md).
- Add other reviewers through @-mentions if you're not qualified to review
a piece of code.
- Understand what the code is doing.
- Give a clear indication when you have completed and approved the review, or
of what the next steps for the requester are.
