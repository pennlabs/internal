The full logo should be used either:
- In color, using Labs_color.png
- In monochrome, using one of the options above, or using your own color. (To
  use your own color, you can edit the Illustrator file and change
  the shape fill colors.)

The square logo can be used with any solid color. You may want to edit the
Illustrator file if your desired color is not provided above.
